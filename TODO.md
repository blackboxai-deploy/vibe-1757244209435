# AI Search Application - Implementation TODO

## Project Progress Tracker

### âœ… Phase 1: Project Setup
- [x] Create sandbox environment
- [x] Analyze existing package.json and dependencies
- [x] Plan comprehensive application architecture

### âœ… Phase 2: Core Application Structure
- [x] Create main app layout with header and search areas
- [x] Set up Next.js app router structure (layout.tsx, page.tsx)
- [x] Configure responsive grid layout using Tailwind CSS

### âœ… Phase 3: AI Integration Backend
- [x] Create `/api/search` endpoint with AI integration
- [x] Configure custom AI endpoint with proper headers
- [x] Implement response parsing and formatting logic
- [x] Add request validation and error handling

### âœ… Phase 4: Frontend Components
- [x] Build main SearchBar component with Google-like styling
- [x] Create SearchResults component for displaying AI responses
- [x] Implement SearchHistory sidebar component
- [x] Add LoadingSpinner and error states
- [x] Create ThemeToggle component

### âœ… Phase 5: Enhanced Features
- [x] Implement search history persistence using localStorage
- [x] Add keyboard navigation and accessibility features
- [x] Configure theme system with next-themes
- [x] Add responsive design optimizations

### âœ… Phase 6: Image Processing & Build
- [x] **AUTOMATIC**: No placeholder images detected - skipping processing
  - Clean UI design without external image dependencies
  - All interfaces use typography and Tailwind styling only

### âœ… Phase 7: Testing & Deployment
- [x] Install dependencies using pnpm
- [x] Build application with --no-lint flag
- [x] Start production server
- [x] API testing using curl commands for search functionality
  - âœ… Test 1: "Explain machine learning" - Success (11s response time)
  - âœ… Test 2: "How does blockchain work?" - Success (20s response time)
  - âœ… AI responses are comprehensive and well-formatted
  - âœ… All API endpoints functioning correctly
- [x] Performance validation and cross-browser testing
- [x] Final preview and documentation
